	<text>Black Mesa: Source is the Half-Life 2 total conversion of the original Half-Life game. Utilizing the Source engine and its endless array of possibilities and powers, Black Mesa: Source will throw you into the world that started the Half-Life continuum and introduced Gordon Freeman to the world as a gun-toting, bullet-dodging, Ph.D Theoretical Physist.<BR>
	Black Mesa: Source was built and founded on the principle that Half-Life: Source did not do the original title enough credit, regardless of the true intentions laid out with the release of Half-Life: Source by Valve Software. Subsequently in November 2004, Black Mesa: Source was founded and set out to reconstruct the original title, giving it the new environments, models and abilities it deserved on the Source engine. This total conversion will not require Half-Life: Source installed on your system to play, only a legitimate and working version of Half-Life 2. At the present time, Valve Software is not associated or involved with the development of this project.  </text>
